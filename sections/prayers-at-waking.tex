\prayer{Hymns to the Trinity.}

On rising from sleep, we fall down before you, O Good One,
and we cry to you with the Angels' hymn, O Mighty One:
Holy, holy, holy are you, O God;
through the Mother of God have mercy on us.

\textit{\glory.}

You have roused me, Lord, from my bed and from sleep;
to hymn you, O Holy Trinity:
Holy, holy, holy are you, O God;
through the Mother of God have mercy on us.

\textit{\bothnow.}

The Judge will come suddenly, and the deeds of each will be
laid bare;
but with fear let us cry to you in the middle of the night:
Holy, Holy,Holy are you, O God.
Through the Mother of God have mercy on us.\\
